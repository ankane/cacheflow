# Cacheflow

Colorized logging for Memcached and Redis

![Screenshot](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ankane/64d630db934c5222587794232a690864/raw/880b70fdbd2d11ccc8475f4616397184918852e8/console.png)

Works with the Rails cache, as well as [Dalli](https://github.com/petergoldstein/dalli) and [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb) clients directly

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cacheflow', group: :development
```

When your log level is set to `DEBUG` (Rails default in development), all commands to Memcached and Redis are logged.

## Features

To silence logging, use:

```ruby
Cacheflow.silence do
  # code
end
```

To silence logging for [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) commands, create an initializer with:

```ruby
Cacheflow.silence_sidekiq!
```

## Data Protection

If you use Cacheflow in an environment with [personal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information) and store that data in Memcached or Redis, it can end up in your app logs. To avoid this, silence logging for those calls.
